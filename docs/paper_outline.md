## Paper Outline

Kevin's 5 components
1. Explain the logic behind the method, 
2. Give examples of people that have used it 
3. Explain the logic behind why it does not work - including critiques by others
4. Show the simulations 
5. Give a list of alternative ways to estimate parasite-induced mortality

Journal Targets: Journal of Parasitology, International journal of parasitology.

## Outline

1. Intro (SW)
    * Why do you want to estimate parasite mortality in the first place
    * Explain the logic behind the method (KP 1)
    * Give examples of people that have used it (KP 2)

2. The method/model (MW)
    * Outline the traditional way to estimate parasite induced-mortality
    * Start with the historical approach.
        * Assumptions        
3. Results (MW + SW)
    * Simulation results (KP 4)
        * You can get the right answer for the wrong reasons.  You might think the method works but it doesn't.
    * 
4. Discussion (SW and MW)
    * Distinction between the assumptions and the limitations
    * Why is it not working?
    * Some new fangled approaches (Bayesian/Full Likelihood approach) 
        * Show why these also have some problems
    * Other more intensive methods for estimating pi-mortality
    * Any other suggestions for estimating pi-mortality from distributional data alone?
    * Logic behind why it doesn't work and historical critiques  (KP 3)
    * Give a list of alternative ways to estimate parasite-induced mortality (KP 5)

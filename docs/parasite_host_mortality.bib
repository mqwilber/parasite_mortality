abstract = {The impact of the parasitic swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara, Niimi \& Itagaki, on European eel populations is assessed with reference to published research on its origin and rapid dissemination, life cycle and transmission dynamics, and its pathogenic effect. The parasite was originally endemic to East Asia, but has transferred from its native host, the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica Temminck \& Schlegel, to the European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.) and American eel, Anguilla rostrata (Le Seur). Anguillicola crassus is a very successful colonizer and is now known to occur in four continents (Asia, Europe, Africa and America). The nematode can severely impair swimbladder function and has caused mortalities in both farmed and wild populations in the presence of other stressors. Anguillicola crassus may impair the capacity of European eels to complete the spawning migration, although direct evidence is not available to support this hypothesis. Areas for future research are recommended.},

abstract = {The effect of echinostome infections on the survival of Rana pipiens tadpoles was examined in relation to developmental stage of tadpoles. Individual tadpoles of Gosner stages 25, 27, 32-33, and 37-39 were exposed to 1 of 4 levels of cercariae (0, 20, 50, or 100). Only tadpoles at stage 25, the earliest stage infected, died within a 5-day experimental period. This stage-specific mortality rate could be explained, in part, by the stage-specific location of encystment of cercariae, which was documented in a separate experiment. In accordance with kidney development, cercariae predominately encysted in the pronephroi during early stages of tadpole development (stages 25 through 31-32) and only in the mesonephroi and associated ducts at later stages (stages 37 through 46). As the mesonephros develops, renal capacity presumably increases. Thus, tadpoles died only when metacercariae concentrated in the functional portion of the kidney with the most limited renal capacity. As tadpoles aged, they also became less susceptible to infections. On average, 69.5\% of cercariae that were exposed to stage 25-26 tadpoles successfully encysted. compared with only 8.4\% of cercariae exposed to stage 37-38 tadpoles. Exposures of metamorphic frogs (poststage 46) to cercariae revealed that these individuals can become infected with echinostomes. Collectively, our data highlight the host stage-dependent dynamics of tadpole-echinostome interactions.},

abstract = {Interactions among coinfecting parasites have the potential to alter host susceptibility to infection, the progression of disease and the efficacy of disease control measures. It is therefore essential to be able to accurately infer the occurrence and direction of such interactions from parasitological data. Due to logistical constraints, perturbation experiments are rarely undertaken to directly detect interactions, therefore a variety of approaches are commonly used to infer them from patterns of parasite association in observational data. However, the reliability of these various approaches is not known. We assess the ability of a range of standard analytical approaches to detect known interactions between infections of nematodes and intestinal coccidia (Eimeria) in natural small-mammal populations, as revealed by experimental perturbations. We show that correlation-based approaches are highly unreliable, often predicting strong and highly significant associations between nematodes and Eimeria in the opposite direction to the underlying interaction. The most reliable methods involved longitudinal analyses, in which the nematode infection status of individuals at one month is related to the infection status by Eimeria the next month. Even then, however, we suggest these approaches are only viable for certain types of infections and datasets. Overall we suggest that, in the absence of experimental approaches, careful consideration be given to the choice of statistical approach when attempting to infer interspecific interactions from observational data.},

That is pretty bizzare actually. Fenton 2010 showed that the methods tend to do better with positive correlations.

abstract = {Frequency distributions from 49 published wildlife host-macroparasite systems were analysed by maximum likelihood for goodness of fit to the negative binomial distribution. In 45 of the 49 (90\%) data-sets, the negative binomial distribution provided a statistically satisfactory fit. In the other 4 data-sets the negative binomial distribution still provided a better fit than the Poisson distribution, and only 1 of the data-sets fitted the Poisson distribution. The degree of aggregation was large, with 43 of the 49 data-sets having an estimated k of less than 1. From these 49 data-sets, 22 subsets of host data were available (i.e. host data could be divided by either host sex, age, where or when hosts were sampled). In 11 of these 22 subsets there was significant variation in the degree of aggregation between host subsets of the same host-parasite system. A common k estimate was always larger than that obtained with all the host data considered together. These results indicate that lumping host data can hide important variations in aggregation between hosts and can exaggerate the true degree of aggregation. Wherever possible common k estimates should be used to estimate the degree of aggregation. In addition, significant differences in the degree of aggregation between subgroups of host data, were generally associated with significant differences in both mean parasite burdens and the prevalence of infection.},

abstract = {1. The population dynamics of red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoficus and theparasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis were explored to determine whetherinteractions between the parasite and host were sufficient to generate cycles ingrouse abundance. Two alternative models were used that explicitly consider thedynamics of either the free-living, or arrested larval stages of the parasite.2. Providing that the life expectancy of the free-living larvae is more than 2-4weeks, the parasite can readily establish in grouse populations. Larval arrestmenttends to reduce the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite and thus increases the sizeof the host population required for the parasite to establish.3. Grouse numbers will tend to cycle when the parasites exhibit low degrees ofaggregation and parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity are greater thanparasite-induced increases in host mortality. The population cycles produced inthe model have the slow increase followed by a rapid decline characteristic of thegrouse population studied at Gunnerside.4. The period of the cycles is determined by the intrinsic growth rate of the grousepopulation and either larval life expectancy (Model I), or the duration of larvalarrestment (Model 11). Cycle periods decrease as host population growth rateincreases, and lengthen with increases in either free-living larval life expectancy,or the duration of larval arrestment. If the duration of larval arrestment is sufficientlylong (>6 months), the cycles die out and the dynamics of the grouse-nematodesystem are very stable.5. Estimates of all of the model's parameters may be made from long-term recordsof grouse populations. Numerical analysis of the model's behaviour suggest that amodel with limited arrested larval stages more closely corresponds to the grousepopulations in the North of England. The 4-5 year cycles exhibited by these populationswill be more sporadic, or absent on estates where the parasite is unableto establish.6. The analysis shows that the empirical data collected on T. tenuis are consistentwith it being the cause of the cycles observed in grouse populations in the Northof England.},

abstract = {There is great interest in the occurrence and consequences of interspecific interactions among co-infecting parasites. However, the extent to which interactions occur is unknown, because there are no validated methods for their detection. We developed a model that generated abundance data for two interacting macroparasite (e.g., helminth) species, and challenged the data with various approaches to determine whether they could detect the underlying interactions. Current approaches performed poorly - either suggesting there was no interaction when, in reality, there was a strong interaction occurring, or inferring the presence of an interaction when there was none. We suggest the novel application of a generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM)-based approach, which we show to be more reliable than current approaches, even when infection rates of both parasites are correlated (e.g., via a shared transmission route). We suggest that the lack of clarity regarding the presence or absence of interactions in natural systems may be largely attributed to the unreliable nature of existing methods for detecting them. However, application of the GLMM approach may provide a more robust method of detection for these potentially important interspecific interactions from ecological data.},

@article{Hechinger2011a,
abstract = {In some of the most complex animal societies, individuals exhibit a cooperative division of labour to form castes. The most pronounced types of caste formation involve reproductive and non-reproductive forms that are morphologically distinct. In colonies comprising separate or mobile individuals, this type of caste formation has been recognized only among the arthropods, sea anemones and mole-rats. Here, we document physical and behavioural caste formation in a flatworm. Trematode flatworm parasites undergo repeated clonal reproduction of 'parthenitae' within their molluscan hosts forming colonies. We present experimental and observational data demonstrating specialization among trematode parthenitae to form distinct soldier and reproductive castes. Soldiers do not reproduce, have relatively large mouthparts, and are much smaller and thinner than reproductives. Soldiers are also more active, and are disproportionally common in areas of the host where invasions occur. Further, only soldiers readily and consistently attack heterospecifics and conspecifics from other colonies. The division of labour described here for trematodes is strongly analogous to that characterizing other social systems with a soldier caste. The parallel caste formation in these systems, despite varying reproductive mode and taxonomic affiliation, indicates the general importance of ecological factors in influencing the evolution of social behaviour. Further, the 'recognition of self' and the defence of the infected host body from invading parasites are comparable to aspects of immune defence. A division of labour is probably widespread among trematodes and trematode species encompass considerable taxonomic, life history and environmental diversity. Trematodes should therefore provide new, fruitful systems to investigate the ecology and evolution of sociality.},

abstract = {Invading infectious diseases can, in theory, lead to the extinction of host populations, particularly if reservoir species are present or if disease transmission is frequency-dependent. The number of historic or prehistoric extinctions that can unequivocally be attributed to infectious disease is relatively small, but gathering firm evidence in retrospect is extremely difficult. Amphibian chytridiomycosis and Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) are two very different infectious diseases that are currently threatening to cause extinctions in Australia. These provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the processes of disease-induced extinction and possible management strategies. Both diseases are apparently recent in origin. Tasmanian DFTD is entirely host-specific but potentially able to cause extinction because transmission depends weakly, if at all, on host density. Amphibian chytridiomycosis has a broad host range but is highly pathogenic only to some populations of some species. At present, both diseases can only be managed by attempting to isolate individuals or populations from disease. Management options to accelerate the process of evolution of host resistance or tolerance are being investigated in both cases. Anthropogenic changes including movement of diseases and hosts, habitat destruction and fragmentation and climate change are likely to increase emerging disease threats to biodiversity and it is critical to further develop strategies to manage these threats.},

abstract = {Multiple analytical techniques were used to evaluate the impact of multiple parasite species on the mortality of threatened juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from the West Fork Smith River, Oregon, USA. We also proposed a novel parsimonious mathematical representation of macroparasite distribution, congestion rate, which (i) is easier to use than traditional models, and (ii) is based on Malthusian parameters rather than probability theory. Heavy infections of Myxobolus insidiosus (Myxozoa) and metacercariae of Nanophyetus salmincola and Apophallus sp. occurred in parr (subyearlings) from the lower mainstem of this river collected in 2007 and 2008. Smolts (yearlings) collected in 2007-2010 always harboured fewer Apophallus sp. with host mortality recognised as a function of intensity for this parasite. Mean intensity of Apophallus sp. in lower mainstem parr was 753 per fish in 2007 and 856 per fish in 2008, while parr from the tributaries had a mean of only 37 or 13 parasites per fish, respectively. Mean intensity of this parasite in smolts ranged between 47 and 251 parasites per fish. Over-dispersion (variance to mean ratios) of Apophallus sp. was always lower in smolts compared with all parr combined or lower mainstem parr. Retrospective analysis based on smolt data using both the traditional negative binomial truncation technique and our proposed congestion rate model showed identical results. The estimated threshold level for mortality involving Apophallus sp. was at 400-500 parasites per fish using both analytical methods. Unique to this study, we documented the actual existence of these heavy infections prior to the predicted mortality. Most of the lower mainstem parr (approximately 75\%) had infections above this level. Heavy infections of Apophallus sp. metacercariae may be an important contributing factor to the high over-wintering mortality previously reported for these fish that grow and develop in this section of the river. Analyses using the same methods for M.insidiosus and N. salmincola generally pointed to minimal parasite-associated mortality.},

abstract = {Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) of small ruminants and other livestock have major economic impacts worldwide. Despite the impact of the diseases caused by these nematodes and the discovery of new therapeutic agents (anthelmintics), there has been relatively limited progress in the development of practical molecular tools to study the epidemiology of these nematodes. Specific diagnosis underpins parasite control, and the detection and monitoring of anthelmintic resistance in livestock parasites, presently a major concern around the world. The purpose of the present article is to provide a concise account of the biology and knowledge of the epidemiology of the gastrointestinal nematodes (order Strongylida), from an Australian perspective, and to emphasize the importance of utilizing advanced molecular tools for the specific diagnosis of nematode infections for refined investigations of parasite epidemiology and drug resistance detection in combination with conventional methods. It also gives a perspective on the possibility of harnessing genetic, genomic and bioinformatic technologies to better understand parasites and control parasitic diseases.},

abstract = {It is well known that parasites are often highly aggregated on their hosts such that relatively few individuals host the large majority of parasites. When the parasites are vectors of infectious disease, a key consequence of this aggregation can be increased disease transmission rates. The cause of this aggregation, however, is much less clear, especially for parasites such as arthropod vectors, which generally spend only a short time on their hosts. Regression-based analyses of ticks on various hosts have focused almost exclusively on identifying the intrinsic host characteristics associated with large burdens, but these efforts have had mixed results; most host traits examined have some small influence, but none are key. An alternative approach, the Poisson-gamma mixture distribution, has often been used to describe aggregated parasite distributions in a range of host/macroparasite systems, but lacks a clear mechanistic basis. Here, we extend this framework by linking it to a general model of parasite accumulation. Then, focusing on blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on mice (Peromyscus leucopus), we fit the extended model to the best currently available larval tick burden datasets via hierarchical Bayesian methods, and use it to explore the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on observed tick burdens. Our results suggest that simple bad luck-inhabiting a home range with high vector density-may play a much larger role in determining parasite burdens than is currently appreciated.},

abstract = {The role of parasites in influencing the trophic dynamics of hosts is becoming increasingly recognized in the ecological literature. Echinococcus granulosus is a tapeworm that relies on the predator-prey relationship between the definitive host (wolf, Canis lupus) and the intermediate host, (moose, Alces alces) to complete its life cycle. Heavy infection by E. granulosus may predispose moose to increased risk of predation by wolves. Theory predicts that parasite-induced vulnerability to predation will reduce the degree of aggregation of parasites in a host population. We tested for different levels of aggregation of E. granulosus in moose in areas of low, moderate, and high levels of wolf predation using Green's coefficient of dispersion. Parasite aggregation was lower in an area with high predation rate, thus we hypothesize that heavy infection by E. granulosus predisposes moose to predation by wolves. This increase in predation rate due to parasite infection may influence the role of wolves in regulating moose populations. We discuss alternative explanations for the negative correlation between predation rate and parasite aggregation.},

abstract = {Complex life cycle helminths use their intermediate hosts as both a source of nutrients and as transportation. There is an assumed trade-off between these functions in that parasite growth may reduce host survival and thus transmission. The virulence of larval helminths can be assessed by experimentally increasing infection intensities and recording how parasite biomass and host mortality scale with intensity. I summarize the literature on these relationships in larval helminths and I provide an empirical example using the nematode Camallanus lacustris in its copepod first host. In all species studied thus far, including C. lacustris, overall parasite volume increases with intensity. Although a few studies observed host survival to decrease predictably with intensity, several studies found no intensity-dependent mortality or elevated mortality only at extreme intensities. For instance, no intensity-dependent mortality was observed in male copepods infected with C. lacustris, whereas female survival was reduced only at high intensities (>3) and only after worms were fully developed. These observations suggest that at low, natural intensity levels parasites do not exploit intermediate hosts as much as they presumably could and that increased growth would not obviously entail survival costs.},

The model is used to study the long-run and transient effect on cattle of culling badgers and the effect of a period without routine testing for TB, such as occurred during the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain. Finally, by examining the changes in cattle TB over the last 15 years, and with some other working assumptions, it is estimated that the net reproduction number of the epidemic is approximately 1.1. The implications for controlling the disease are discussed.},

A formula for the calculation of the probability of infection of a susceptible animal was first established. A deterministic failure threshold of the infection was then deduced. Deterministic and stochastic approaches were adopted using iterative methods on a computer. These allowed a description of the spread and the variability of an infection process in a population to be made. An illustration of the use of this model showed that, in some cases, variability effects due to stochastic factors were very important. In these particular conditions, the use of the deterministic model alone was not adequate for a good description of the infection. Consequently, improvements of the model were proposed in order to make it more realistic and to allow its use for the evaluation of the efficiency of field operations.},

abstract = {Abstract: Disease threats to endangered species are most commonly caused by exotic microparasites accidentally introduced into na\"{\i}ve populations by humans. The case of raccoon roundworm ( Baylisascaris procyonis ) and the Allegheny woodrat ( Neotoma magister ) is an exception to this general rule and, as such, may be useful in the identification of other macroparasite disease threats in the future. B. procyonis is an intestinal nematode of raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) that is highly pathogenic in intermediate hosts. It is hypothesized to have caused or contributed to the extirpation of the Allegheny woodrat from the northern parts of its range. I tested this hypothesis by reintroducing Allegheny woodrats into four historically occupied sites with varying natural levels of environmental contamination with B. procyonis eggs. Populations were monitored via radiotelemetry and trapping for 22 months. Woodrat populations in less contaminated release sites survived significantly longer than populations in highly contaminated sites, and there was a strong negative correlation between the number of raccoon latrines and woodrat population persistence. This case demonstrates several points relevant to the conservation of small populations: trophically transmitted parasites ( in which prey species serve as intermediate hosts to the parasites of their predators ) can be significant sources of mortality in intermediate host populations; native parasites should not be ignored as potential disease threats; and parasites of human-adapted wild animals are likely to threaten rare and endangered species. This case also illustrates a previously unrecognized route through which host density can be decoupled from disease dynamics and provides evidence of apparent competition in nature. Resumen: Las amenazas a especies en peligro ocasionadas por enfermedades son m\'{a}s com\'{u}nmente causadas por micropar\'{a}sitos introducidos accidentalmente en las poblaciones por humanos. El caso del asc\'{a}rido de los mapaches ( Baylisascaris procyonis ) y de la rata de la madera de Allegheny ( Neotoma magister ) es una excepci\'{o}n a estas generalidades y como tal, puede ser \'{u}til en la identificaci\'{o}n de otras amenazas debidas a enfermedades causadas por macropar\'{a}sitos en el futuro. B. procyonis es un nematodo intestinal en mapaches ( Procyon lotor ) que es altamente patog\'{e}nico en hospederos intermedios. Se postula que este par\'{a}sito ha ocasionado o contribuido a la extirpaci\'{o}n de la rata de la madera de Allegheny en la parte norte\~{n}a de su rango de distribuci\'{o}n. Se puso a prueba esta hip\'{o}tesis mediante la reintroducci\'{o}n de ratas de Allegheny en cuatro sitios hist\'{o}ricamente ocupados con niveles de variaci\'{o}n naturales de contaminaci\'{o}n ambiental con huevos de B. procyonis. Las poblaciones fueron monitoreadas v\'{\i}a radiotelemetr\'{\i}a y trampeo por 22 meses. Las poblaciones de ratas en sitios de liberaci\'{o}n menos contaminados sobrevivieron significativamente periodos m\'{a}s largos que las poblaciones liberadas en sitios altamente contaminados y tuvieron una correlaci\'{o}n negativa fuerte entre el n\'{u}mero de letrinas de mapaches y la persistencia de las ratas de la madera. Este caso demuestra diversos puntos relevantes para la conservaci\'{o}n de poblaciones peque\~{n}as: par\'{a}sitos transmitidos tr\'{o}ficamente ( en los cuales las especies de presas sirven como hospederos intermediarios de los par\'{a}sitos de los depredadores ) pueden ser fuentes significativas de mortalidad en poblaciones intermedias de hospederos; los par\'{a}sitos nativos no deben ser ignorados como potenciales amenazas de enfermedades; y los par\'{a}sitos de animales silvestres acostumbrados a los humanos pueden amenazar a especies raras y en peligro. Este caso tambi\'{e}n ejemplifica una ruta previamente no reconocida mediante la cual la densidad de hospederos puede ser separada de las din\'{a}micas de enfermedades y provee evidencia de una aparente competencia en la naturaleza.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to clarify the concepts of bias, precision and accuracy as they are commonly defined in the biostatistical literature, with our focus on the use of these concepts in quantitatively testing the performance of point estimators (specifically species richness estimators). We first describe the general concepts underlying bias, precision and accuracy, and then describe a number of commonly used unscaled and scaled performance measures of bias, precision and accuracy (e.g. mean error, variance, standard deviation, mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and all their scaled counterparts) which may be used to evaluate estimator performance. We also provide mathematical formulas and a worked example for most performance measures. Since every measure of estimator performance should be viewed as suggestive, not prescriptive, we also mention several other performance measures that have been used by biostatisticians or ecologists. We then outline several guidelines of how to test the performance of species richness estimators: the detailed description of data simulation models and resampling schemes, the use of real and simulated data sets on as many different estimators as possible, mathematical expressions for all estimators and performance measures, and the presentation of results for each scaled performance measure in numerical tables with increasing levels of sampling effort. We finish with a literature review of promising new research related to species richness estimation, and summarize the results of 14 studies that compared estimator performance, which confirm that with most data sets, non-parametric estimators (mostly the Chao and jackknife estimators) perform better than other estimators, e.g. curve models or fitting species-abundance distributions.},

A key division within natural enemies is whether a successful attack eliminates the fitness of the prey or the host. A third distinctive axis for parasites is whether the host must die to further parasite development. The presence or absence of intensity-dependent pathology is a fourth factor that separates macroparasites from microparasites; this also distinguishes between social and solitary predators. Combining these four dichotomies defines seven types of parasitism, seven corresponding parasites, three forms of predation and, when one considers obligate and facultative combinations of these forms, four types of predator. Here, we argue that the energetics underlying the relative and absolute sizes of natural enemies and their victims is the primary selective factor responsible for the evolution of these different trophic strategies.},

**TODOs for PIHM manuscript**

May 7, 2015

1. Figure out limitations of the chi-squared test.  At least one citation
    - Maybe I don't really need to do this
2. Run one additional simulation looking at using the likelihood method with the Crofton Method.
    - Decided to run a simulation just focusing on the "ideal"
3. Try to give a recommendation for sample size for using the Likelihood
     
4. Add in Sara's changes
5. Fill out citations
6. <s>Edit supplementary material</s>

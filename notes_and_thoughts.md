-> Simulate a parasite birth-death process
-> 

->  

A. Enter dataset and see if we get their answer 

B. Ensure the functionality of the log code.

1. Fix the mortality code
2. Log2 Bins for the dataset
3. ln(x) -> why did you add this?
4. We are truncating a lot of our living data.
5. Ensure the survival probability
6. Log 2 bins / truncated negative binomial seems to make more sense...
